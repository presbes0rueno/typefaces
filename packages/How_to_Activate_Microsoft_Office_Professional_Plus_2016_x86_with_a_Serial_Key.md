A product key is a 25-character code that verifies that you have purchased a genuine copy of Microsoft Office. It usually looks like this: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX. You can find your product key on the packaging of your Office product, or in your confirmation email if you bought it online.
 
If you don't have a product key, or if you lost it, you can still activate Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 (x86) with a serial key.
